            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
                prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
                imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
            <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks
                or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming
                languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.</p>

            <header>Javascript</header>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
                pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to
                look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
                jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer
                cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS). </p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
                multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing
                what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Variables</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p> Variable means anything that can vary. In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be
                changed later on.

                Use the reserved keyword <code>var</code> to declare a variable in JavaScript. </p>
            <p> A variable must have a unique name.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
            <header>Scope</header>
            <p>Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of
                variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global:
            <ul>
                <li>Global variables are those declared outside of a block</li>
                <li>Local variables are those declared inside of a block</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>We learned that variables can be reassigned. Using local scope, we can actually create new variables with
                the same name as a variable in an outer scope without changing or reassigning the original value.</p>

            <em>Syntax:</em>

            <code>var [];
        
          var  = ;
          </code>
            <p>Example: Variable Declaration</p>

            <code>var msg; // declaring a variable without assigning a value</code>
            <p> Example: Variable Initialization</p>

            <code>var msg; 
        msg = "Hello JavaScript!"; // assigned a string value
          alert(msg); // access a variable</code>

            <code>//the following declares and assign a numeric value
        var num = 100; 
          var hundred = num;  // assigned a variable to varible</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <p> JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and programming languages.

                In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as
                many times as you want.

            </p>
            <p>A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword. </p>
            <p>A function can have one or more parameters, which will be supplied by the calling code and can be used
                inside a function. JavaScript is a dynamic type scripting language, so a function parameter can have
                value of any data type. For example: </p>
            <code>function ShowMessage(firstName, lastName) {
            alert("Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName);
            }
        
            ShowMessage("Steve", "Jobs");
            ShowMessage("Bill", "Gates");
            ShowMessage(100, 200);
          </code>
